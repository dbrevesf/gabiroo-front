# Gabiroo

This project is being developed as a filter of good news, based on my own definition of good. My aim with this project is to implement a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm which will select, based on past news and my classification, some good news and post them on a Twitter account (@projeto_gabiroo).

## gabiroo_front

It's the frontend part of the main project. I'm developing with Angular.js and Bootstrap in order to achieve a clean design spending not much time. This is my first personal project in Angular.js.
